# Adapta-Colorpack

Modified version of <a href="https://github.com/ivankra/adapta-gtk-theme-colorpack">Adapta-gtk-theme-colorpack</a> created by <a href="https://github.com/ivankra">Ivankra</a>

Bookmarks have been added to the panel that shows which apps are open, this option has been added in Cinnamon!

Soon, I finish the other versions of the theme, in this case, the other colors!

This version no have the Eta version!

For users that not use use metacity WM, use the original Adapta window buttons, it was not possible to harmonize with the design of the metacity window buttons on gtk-3.0 and gtk-3.22!
